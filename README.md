# Glass Block Designer

An application to design the layouts of set of windows made of glass blocks, using a fixed supply of different colors of glass blocks.

## Workflow

The first step is to set up the sizes of the windows:

 - How many windows are there?
 - What size is each window -- how many blocks horizontally, and how many vertically?

 Second, set up the supply of blocks:

 - How many different colors are there?
 - What are the specific colors?

 Third, do the design:

 - The display shows all of the windows, and what they will look like with the selected colors.
 - Click on a color to select it, then click on blocks to set them to that color.
 - The display shows how many blocks are left of each color.

Fourth, save your work:

 - Copy the information from Design Details section and paste it into a file on your computer.

## To Do

 - switch color generation to use HSV; it's a more direct representation of what we want
 - add block supply controls
 - build the design section
